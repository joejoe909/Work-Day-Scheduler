This is a simple workday scheduler Made with HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery. The image really explains it all. It was a good leason on Javascript and jQuery. In additon the google fonts (Rajdani, sans-serif), the font awesome save icon("far fa-save"), and bootstrap classes were utilized in building this project.
